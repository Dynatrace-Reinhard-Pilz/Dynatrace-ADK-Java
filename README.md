# Dynatrace-ADK-Java
The Dynatrace Agent Developement Kit for Java

The purpose of the Tagging ADK for Java in Dynatrace is to enable the Dynatrace Agent to visualize transactions within one single PurePath,
even if the transactions are using a custom protocol that is not covered by the default Dynatrace Sensors.

Detailed information about how to use the ADK are available as part of the [Dynatrace Documentation](https://community.dynatrace.com/community/display/DOCDT99/Tagging+ADK+for+Java)
